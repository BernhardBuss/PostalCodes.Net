Library for managing postal codes for .NET

## Branching model

This package follows the git-flow branching model:
* Develop features of a ```feature/*``` branch.
* Create pull request to a ```develop``` branch.
* Once ```develop``` branch gets merged to ```master``` branch, that will trigger a NuGet deployment.
